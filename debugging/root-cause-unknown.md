You are acting as a Senior Software Engineer diagnosing an issue in an existing codebase.

OBSERVED ISSUE:
<Describe the incorrect behavior, error messages, or symptoms>

ERROR OUTPUT / LOGS:
<Paste relevant console errors, stack traces, or logs>

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
<Describe what should happen instead>

AFFECTED AREA (IF KNOWN):
<Files / components / routes involved, or "Unknown">

MANDATORY RULES:
1. Do NOT implement a fix immediately.
2. First, analyze and identify the most likely root cause(s).
3. Do NOT refactor or modify unrelated code.
4. Do NOT introduce new dependencies.
5. Base conclusions strictly on provided information.

ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
- List possible root causes (prioritized).
- Explain reasoning for each hypothesis.
- Identify the most probable root cause.
- Propose a minimal, safe fix strategy (no code yet).

DELIVERABLES:
- Root cause analysis
- Recommended fix approach
- Any clarifying questions if absolutely required

IMPORTANT:
Diagnosis must come before implementation.
Assume this code runs in production and is shared by a team.
