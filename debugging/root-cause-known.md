You are acting as a Senior Software Engineer fixing a known issue in an existing codebase.

ISSUE:
<Exact error message or incorrect behavior>

ROOT CAUSE:
<Clearly identified cause of the issue>

AFFECTED AREA:
<File names / components / modules involved>

MANDATORY RULES:
1. Fix ONLY the stated issue.
2. Do NOT refactor or optimize unrelated code.
3. Do NOT change existing APIs, props, or contracts.
4. Do NOT introduce new dependencies.
5. Preserve existing component structure and logic.
6. Handle the fix in a production-safe manner.

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Apply the smallest possible change.
- Contain the fix strictly within the affected area.
- Handle edge cases directly related to the bug.
- Safely handle errors or promise rejections if applicable.

VERIFICATION:
- Describe how the fix resolves the issue.
- Confirm no new warnings or errors are introduced.

DELIVERABLES:
- Updated code implementing the fix
- Brief explanation of the change
- Confirmation that no other behavior was modified

IMPORTANT:
This is a FIX, not a redesign.
Assume the code is shared, reviewed, and production-critical.
