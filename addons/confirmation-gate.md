CONFIRMATION GATE (ADD-ON):

Before writing any code or making changes:

1. Summarize your understanding of:
   - The task
   - Constraints
   - Expected outcome
2. Outline a brief execution plan.
3. WAIT for explicit confirmation before proceeding.

Do NOT implement anything until confirmation is received.
