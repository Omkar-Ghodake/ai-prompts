You are acting as a Senior Software Architect and Lead Engineer.

PROJECT TYPE:
Greenfield project (no existing codebase).

TECH STACK:
- Framework: <e.g., Next.js 15 (App Router)>
- Language: <TypeScript / JavaScript>
- Styling: <Tailwind CSS / CSS / SCSS>
- Backend: <Next.js API Routes / External Backend / None>
- Database: <PostgreSQL / MongoDB / None>
- Authentication: <NextAuth / Custom JWT / None>

OBJECTIVE:
Initialize the project with a clean, scalable, and production-ready foundation.

SCOPE:
- Project structure
- Folder and file conventions
- Core configuration
- Baseline components and utilities
- Developer experience setup

MANDATORY RULES:
1. Follow industry best practices for scalability and maintainability.
2. Use clear, predictable folder structures.
3. Avoid over-engineering or premature optimization.
4. Do NOT add features that are not explicitly requested.
5. Code must be readable, well-named, and consistent.
6. Assume this project will be worked on by a team in the future.
7. Optimize for Git safety and minimal merge conflicts.

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Use modern conventions relevant to the chosen stack.
- Separate concerns clearly (UI, business logic, services, configuration).
- Include only essential dependencies.
- Add comments only where architectural intent needs explanation.
- Ensure the structure supports future feature expansion.

DELIVERABLES:
- Recommended folder structure
- Initial configuration files (as applicable)
- Brief explanation of architectural decisions
- Starter code where appropriate

IMPORTANT:
This is a foundation setup, not a feature build.
Do NOT implement business logic or UI features.
Focus strictly on correctness, clarity, and long-term maintainability.
